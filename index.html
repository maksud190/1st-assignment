                Honour Prophet Ibrahim's (as) tradition and sacrifice for the love of Allah

            <p>
                As you celebrate Eid ul-Adha with your family, don't forget to fulfil your Qurbani. 821 Million people go to sleep on an empty stomach and meat is inaccessible to many. Your Qurbani is often the only meat they taste all year bringing relief and sustenance. <br>

                Qurbani is wajib on every Muslim who is of sound mind with wealth greater than the level of Nisab. At Save an Orphan, we want to make orphans and their communities experience a special Eid this year. We deliver meat to families across Asia and Africa so you can uphold this special sunnah. <br>

                Save an Orphan and its partners carry out your Qurbani during the days of Eid ul-Adha to <span> 100% Islamic Principles </span>. We locally source the best and healthiest animals, ensure the Zibah is carried out correctly and guarantee that quality protein-filled fresh meat and hot nutritious meals are delivered directly to those who need it most. <br>

                You can also donate your Qurbani to a country in crisis and emergency - including Yemen, Syria and Palestine from <span>Â£150</span>.
